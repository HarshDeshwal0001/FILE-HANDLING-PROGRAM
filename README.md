##This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in the C programming language. It includes functionality to create a text file, write data to it, read and display its contents, and append additional data to the file. The program uses standard C functions such as fopen(), fprintf(), fgetc(), and fclose() for performing these operations. It also includes basic error handling to ensure files are accessed correctly. The code was written and tested using the GCC compiler on Windows terminal. This project helps understand file modes (w, r, a) and how to use them in practical C programming. Tools used include a text edit VS Code, a terminal or command-line interface for compilation and execution, and the GCC compiler for building the program.
